## 🌱 Currently Learning

- **React.js**: Deepening my knowledge of React.js by exploring advanced concepts such as React Hooks, Context API, and custom hooks. I am also focusing on optimizing React applications for performance and scalability through techniques like code-splitting and lazy loading.
- **Node.js & Express**: Progressing towards full-stack development by gaining more experience with building RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express. I am working on understanding asynchronous programming with callbacks, promises, and async/await for handling API requests effectively.
- **Interactive Projects**: Currently building interactive web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end technologies. I am working on a personal portfolio and blog where I can showcase my projects and share insights about development topics I am passionate about.
- **Version Control**: Getting more comfortable with Git and GitHub for version control, collaborating on open-source projects, and managing the deployment process efficiently using tools like GitHub Actions.

## 📚 Interests Beyond Coding

- **Reading**: In addition to tech books, I enjoy reading novels and self-help books. I’m currently exploring topics like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Personal Development to stay informed about emerging trends in technology and improve my problem-solving skills.
- **Podcasts**: I listen to a variety of podcasts, ranging from tech discussions to productivity tips. Listening to calming podcasts before bedtime helps me unwind and relax, contributing to a better work-life balance.
- **Tech**: I’m passionate about exploring new web technologies, frameworks, and libraries. Staying updated on trends like serverless architecture, WebAssembly, and progressive web apps (PWAs) helps me remain adaptable and ready for future opportunities in development.
- **Photography**: Beyond tech, I am also interested in photography. I enjoy capturing landscapes, cityscapes, and street photography. It’s a creative outlet that helps me appreciate the world around me in a different way.

## 🔨 Projects in Progress

- **Building a Dynamic Blog Platform with React**: I’m working on a personal blog platform that includes features like dynamic content loading, search functionality, and a rich text editor for creating posts. The platform will be fully responsive and will allow me to share my thoughts, tutorials, and insights about web development.
- **Developing a Portfolio Website**: I’m developing a sleek, professional portfolio that showcases my web development skills, projects, and achievements. The website will be a hub where potential clients or employers can learn more about my work and contact me for freelance opportunities.
- **Creating an E-commerce Web App**: In addition to personal projects, I am also experimenting with building an e-commerce application that features product listings, shopping carts, and a secure payment gateway. This project will help me enhance my knowledge of full-stack development, including integrating with third-party APIs for payment processing.
- **Contributing to Open-Source Projects**: I actively contribute to open-source projects by fixing bugs, adding new features, and improving documentation. This experience not only allows me to give back to the community but also helps me improve my coding practices by collaborating with developers from around the world.
